Icon themes for **FreeCAD** (http://www.freecadweb.org/).

![Dark-Blue stylesheet](/../multimedia/img/demo.png?raw=true "Simple iconTheme for FreeCAD")

This icon theme is still in **heavy development** so, actually is not a full icon replacement for FreeCAD GUI. Read following lines to get the current status:

Current status
-------
- **v0.1**: full **Part Design** workbench icons added


Installation
------
1. You need to install **IconThemes** module from [user triplus repository](https://github.com/triplus/IconThemes). Follow its instructions in order to allow FreeCAD to load custom icons.

2. Download the last version of my Simple icon theme and place the folders "Simple_xx_dark" and/or "Simple_xx_light" on (if folder/path doesn't exist create it/them):
  - **OSX** = /Users/[YOUR_USER_NAME]/Library/Preferences/FreeCAD/Gui/Icons/
  - **WINDOWS** = C:/[INSTALLATION_PATH]/FreeCAD/data/Gui/Icons/
  - **LINUX** = /home/[YOUR_USER_NAME]/.FreeCAD/Gui/Icons/

3. Run **FreeCAD** and under "Tools / Accesories / IconThemes" menu select your desired icon theme.

Known bugs and TO DOs
------

- icons under dropdown menus do not work for FreeCAD 0.16 or below and for 0.17 and above they might work (they are being manually fixed so it will take time to fix full GUI)
- other specials icons might not work
